## Introduction :
The world markets are developing rapidly and continuously looking for the best knowledge and experience among people. Young workers who want to stand out in their jobs are always looking for higher degrees that can help them in improving their skills and knowledge. As a result, the number of students applying for graduate studies has increased in the last decade. This fact has motivated us to study the grades of students and the possibility of admission for master’s programs that can help universities in predicting the possibility of accepting master’s students submitting each year and provide the needed resources.

## Abstract :
Student admission problem is very important in educational institutions. This model addresses machine learning models to predict the chance of a student to be admitted to a master’s program. This will assist students to know in advance if they have a chance to get accepted. The machine learning models are multiple linear regression, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, and Multilayer Perceptron. Experiments show that the Multilayer Perceptron model surpasses other models.

## Description of Dataset :
The dataset presented in this paper is related to educational domain. Admission is a dataset with 500 rows that contains 7 different independent variables which are:

 1. Graduate Record Exam1 (GRE) score. The score will be out of 340 points.

 2. Test of English as a Foreigner Language2 (TOEFL) score, which will be out of 120 points.

 3. University Rating (Uni.Rating) that indicates the Bachelor University ranking among the other universities. 
   The score will be out of 5.

 4. Statement of purpose (SOP) which is a document written to show the candidate's life, ambitious and the motivations 
   for the chosen degree/ university. The score will be out of 5 points.

 5. Letter of Recommendation Strength (LOR) which verifies the candidate professional experience, builds 
   credibility, boosts confidence and ensures your competency. The score is out of 5 points

 6. Undergraduate GPA (CGPA) out of 10.

 7. Research Experience that can support the application, such as publishing research papers in conferences, 
   working as research assistant with university professor (either 0 or 1).

 8. Chance of Admit - One dependent variable can be predicted which is chance of admission, 
   that is according to the input given will be ranging from 0 to 1. ( ranging from 0 to 1 )

## Problem Statement :
The objective of this project is:

Our goal here would be to predict the “Chance of Admit” based on the different parameters that are provided in the dataset.
